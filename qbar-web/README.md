# Web Application Wrapper

See the [web application library](../qbar/src/backend/web.rs) for more information.

## Building

To build the application from Rust, we use `cargo-make` as a build tool and `wasm-pack` to bundle the application. Both can be installed using the following command:

```sh
cargo install cargo-make wasm-pack
```
