## Introduction

**QBAR** is an experimental automated theorem verifier/prover and proof assistant built on a simple abstract syntax language and a minimal proof kernel.

## Installation

**QBAR** is currently an _&alpha;-stage product_ and the terminal shell cannot be installed at the moment. For now, check out **QBAR**'s dependent libraries ([`exprz`](https://github.com/qdeduction/exprz) and [`rational_deduction`](https://github.com/qdeduction/rational_deduction)) or try the [web shell](https://qbar.io/app).

## Documentation

See the [web docs](https://qbar.io/docs) for the most up-to-date documentation.
